Hello, I am currently in my last semester of my undergraduate studies in buisness analytics and data science. I wanted to show my expertise and knowledge, although extrmely limited,
in building models for real world applications where companies would be able to theoretically extract actionable insights from. Always open for suggestions and feedback into how to
improve. You can reach out to me through multiple channels but preferably my email, connorhuis@gmail.com. I enjoyed building this relativly simple model which produced okay results 
on the binary dataset and I hope you enjoy reading through it.
